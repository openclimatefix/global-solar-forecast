## FAQ

### Where do we get the capacities data from?

We try to get the data from credieble sources. Ember providers most of the solar capacites, there are some countries missing. We try to be as open as possible where we got these figures from

### As more solar panels get installed, how do we updated the capacities? 

We should do this as often as possible. Probably this will happen yearly. 

### How accuracte is the forecast? 

That's a great question. Honestly we are not sure. For some countries, the amount of solar generation is published and we can compare the forecast again that. For other countries its very hard to get ground truth. This is partly due to solar panels are placed in lots of locations (not just one power station). 

### What if I want a more accurate forecast?

Please reach out to info@openclimatefix.org, we already providing very high accuracy forecast in the UK, India and a few other countries.
